The project is about the recreation of the infamous attraction "The Pyramid of Giza". The program platform is 3D and the shader used is URP, it only included a few C#
codes in it since it is mostly created through asset design and asset creation. The assets were gathered from the different 3D marketplace in the net and some of it is
made by the game designers through Unity's ProBuilder Feature. The program can be viewed using a VR tool through the software "Altspace VR". In this program, I was in
charge of the optimization of the light where I baked lights and find the right settings. In the program, I created the entire Queens Chamber structure and the
decorations inside.
